# Product Search by Supplier Code - Implementation Summary

## Overview

We've enhanced the product search functionality to allow users to search for products using supplier codes. This feature makes it easier for users to find products when they have only the supplier-specific code available.

## Changes Made

### 1. Enhanced API Service (`api.js`)

- Added a new function `getBySupplierCode` to the `productApi` service to fetch products by supplier code
- Updated the existing `search` function to also consider supplier codes when filtering products
- Implemented proper error handling and fallback to mock data when needed

### 2. Improved Search Dropdown UI (`ProductSearchDropdown.jsx`)

- Added a dedicated supplier code search feature in the `performSearch` method
- Enhanced the display of supplier codes in search results with a blue background and bold text
- Implemented prioritization of supplier code search to show exact matches first

### 3. Updated Product Page Search (`ProductsPage.jsx`)

- Modified the `handleSearch` function to use the new supplier code search functionality
- Added a cascading search approach:
  1. First try `productApi.getBySupplierCode` (new implementation)
  2. If not found, try `productItemApi.getProductBySupplierCode` as fallback
  3. If still not found, fall back to regular search
- Improved error handling to ensure smooth user experience

## User Experience Improvements

- Users can now quickly find products using supplier codes
- Supplier codes are highlighted in search results with a blue background for better visibility
- The search prioritizes exact supplier code matches, making it faster to find specific products
- Improved error handling ensures the application works smoothly even when searches fail

## Technical Implementation Details

- Used axios for API requests with proper timeout and error handling
- Implemented debouncing for search input to reduce unnecessary API calls
- Added proper formatting and styling for supplier code display
- Ensured backward compatibility with existing search functionality
