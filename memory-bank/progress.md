# Progress Tracking

## What Works
- ✅ Basic application structure (frontend + backend)
- ✅ OCR processing of invoice images
- ✅ Database schema and models
- ✅ Invoice listing in HistoryPage
- ✅ Product database management
- ✅ Backend API endpoints
- ✅ Invoice details display
- ✅ Frontend routing and navigation

## In Progress
- 🔄 Environment variable configuration
  - Backend now correctly loads from root `.env`
  - Frontend configuration updated but needs verification
  - Vite config updated to use root `.env` file
  
- 🔄 HistoryPage product details
  - Backend `getInvoiceDetails` function updated to fetch product data
  - Frontend display needs to show both supplier and internal product information
  - Testing needed to verify correct data mapping

## Known Issues
- ❌ Environment variable loading in frontend
  - Frontend using fallback values instead of `.env` values
  - May require restarting development server
  
- ❌ HistoryPage expandable rows
  - Currently only shows invoice item data
  - Need to map supplier codes to internal product codes
  - SQL query may be incorrect in `getInvoiceDetails` function
  
- ❌ API URL configuration
  - Some endpoints may be missing `/api` prefix
  - Inconsistent use of base URL across components

## Next Development Tasks
1. **Environment Configuration**
   - Verify frontend correctly loads environment variables
   - Test with actual API calls

2. **HistoryPage Enhancements**
   - Complete product data lookup functionality
   - Display both supplier and internal product data
   - Improve error handling for database lookups

3. **UI Improvements**
   - Visual indication of database lookup success
   - Better error messaging for failed lookups
   - Loading states during data fetching

## Future Features
- 📋 Advanced OCR validation
- 📋 User authentication and authorization
- 📋 Advanced reporting and analytics
- 📋 Export functionality for invoice data
- 📋 Integration with accounting systems
